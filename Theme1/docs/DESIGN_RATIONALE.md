# Aurora Atelier · Design Rationale

## Editorial intent
The template rejects typical SaaS layout conventions and leans into magazine pacing. Oversized typography, asymmetry, and deliberate whitespace create emotional impact before information density.

## Visual hierarchy
- Display serif headlines establish the brand voice.
- Sans-serif UI text maintains legibility and rhythm.
- Accent labels act like print captions.

## Mood system
Each mood palette is designed as a narrative environment:
- **Warm Editorial**: tactile, sunlit warmth
- **Nordic Minimal**: restrained, gallery-like calm
- **Dark Cinematic**: high-contrast nightlife
- **Vibrant Artistic**: energetic, experimental color

Mood tokens extend Material 3 so gradients, shadows, and ambient glow remain consistent across screens.

## Motion language
Motion is treated as choreography:
- Scroll reveals for editorial pacing
- Parallax layering in the story view
- Soft entrance curves for transitions

## Dashboards
Dashboards are modular experiences with their own sub-themes. Each mode emphasizes a different narrative:
- **Analytics**: signal and trend
- **Activity**: cadence and workflow
- **Personal**: ritual and wellbeing
